KSP India Police Hackathon Table no 14

Description:

Each police station's jurisdiction is divided into beats for the performance of its core policing functions. Beat constable is the main resource performing this task.The presence of the beat constable and the way he performs is at the base of policing.The beat system is designed to ensure the same.The gaps still remain humongous Beat is served at a particular time of the month / day / night depending on the frequency nature / type of crime. It should take care of surveillance of criminal elements of al types, gather information on the criminal activities in the area and take action in that Beat.What we are looking for is a centralised beat management too to be assigned to the Station House Officer to ensure better beat monitoring system to reduce crime rate in the respective beats based on beat crime data patterns,cumulatively Police Station in general. Scaling it further, the Circle Police Inspector, the DySP and the SP of the district would be able to utilize this tool for centralised control monitoring supervision strategizing and decision making.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
